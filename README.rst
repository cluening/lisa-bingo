LISA Bingo! is a lighthearted and completely unofficial way for
attendees at `LISA 2016 <https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16>`_
to poke some fun at our own foibles.

TO DO
=====

LISA 2016 is just around the corner, but there's plenty to do. The two biggest
areas of improvement are:

* Prettiness. Right now it's incredibly, wildly ugly. Better
  stylesheets will make it prettier, and more mobile-friendly.
* Categories. We need more! We currently have 23, so we only really
  *need* one more, but even more would be fun.

Categories need to conform to the `USENIX Event Code of Conduct
<https://www.usenix.org/conferences/coc>`_.
